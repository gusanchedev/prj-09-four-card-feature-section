### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

How to connect tailwind to html:
```html
  <body>
    <main-container id="app">
    </main-container>
    <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
  </body>
```
Using Breakpoint prefix for responsive design:
```html
<div class="bg-white md:col-start-1 md:row-start-1 text-right mx-8 md:mx-4 my-6 md:mt-40 p-5 rounded-md border-t-4 border-prj9Cyan shadow-xl">
    <p class="text-VeryDarkBlue text-2xl font-bold text-left">Supervisor</p>
    <p class="text-VeryDarkBlue text-sm md:text-base font-semibold opacity-50 mt-2 my-6 md:h-20 leading-7 text-left">Monitors activity to identify project roadblocks </p>
    <img class="inline" src="./images/icon-supervisor.svg" alt="">
</div>
```

### Continued development

I'll continue using these two frameworks in the upcoming projects.
